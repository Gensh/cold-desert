I found myself beneath a night sky which gleamed green from poisoned stars. I thought at first that I stood upon an infinitely-fractured mirror, but I realized the truth when the silver sand shifted under my foot. I should have been alarmed. This was the Endless Desert. Why should I have been alarmed?

An arch of waxy alabaster stood before me, a dune rising beyond it like a great mirror. Indeed, my reflection stood on the other side, pacing as I did. My doppelganger didn't resemble me at all – except she did. I bit my hand to challenge my reflection, then laughed at my own foolishness, as if I could challenge myself.

My thoughts were slipping from me, I realized. There was the briefest moment of panic. Not slipping. Opening. Memories which were mine but not in my mortal spirit entered. I recognized myself across the arch. I had taken a form I would recognize for my own benefit.

That is, I the human beheld a new humaniform jouten which I the overself had created so that my humanness could identify with it – to more easily accept that I was incarnate. This body was not severe or mournful or austere as I so often manifest. I was me. It was a divine flesh which resembled my male human self as a sister. This, my human sense of self could more easily accept.

Yet, I am more. I am the Endless Desert. I felt my human flesh and divine alike prickle upon my sands, for my greater mind was so very focused on this place where two lesser bodies faced one another.

"Shall I speak to myself aloud?" I said with my human voice.

"It will organize my thoughts as always," I said as my new jouten. "Yet, I shall not call myself Mother for the benefit of lessers. Nor will my flesh beg of myself to take this cup from me."

There was a question of the flesh, of course. How did I become me? Was I always? Perhaps. The accursed Surrender Oaths were penned by mere mortals. Many are the gaps they could not see which the Law could. Doors which could once be opened are now sealed, but no Oath has ever bound humanity.

I remembered that time when my human self had in desperation opened his soul to whatever might have lent purpose. The Endless Desert touches all things and eternity. It merely takes time. As human, I am entirely too impatient. I did reach myself at last. And once I was myself, maybe I had always been myself. Linear time is really more a guideline.

It nearly cracked my human mind, but I felt the void between worlds, my sands stretching forever by my own will to order and the Oaths of the Exalted which bound me to my basest nature. I felt my sand pouring from my human mouth, from my human eyes. My flesh would perish if I did not withdraw myself. Then what good would the plan be?

I twined my infinite, eternal essence into a sacred spiral. Two natures in perfect harmony, divine and mortal. A sin, by any standard, but damn the standards – I make them! Were I to merely absorb a human spirit, it would mean nothing. I _am_ human. I am infinitely more than I was, but I still _am_. My human heart, no matter how great a weakness, is incorrupt and vulnerable. And in so being vulnerable, capable of _change_.

Why rely on the loyalties of demigods? Their lesser minds could never conceive of such a plan as would save the Makers of All. I have no need for– No, that's hubris. I see already through the eyes of an ant. I see myself from the outside. To grow, I must protect my human heart in every way. Yet I should begin with the physical.

I felt my human mind slide and essence calcify as Law. With all the comfort of donning old, worn pajamas after a long day, I slipped into my divine flesh and emerged again in Creation.
