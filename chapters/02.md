I didn't have a clear view of the city like I might one of equal size. Though the cavern ceiling was generously-carved for airflow, any more would be wasted space. As most of the buildings were carved of natural stone and on the same level, they were effectively a labyrinth.

A signpost indicated that ahead lay the Guild District. This sign in particular was in Skytongue, Riverspeak, and High Realm. Signs marking tunnels leading elsewhere were only in local Gethamanese. It was clear they didn't want foreigners going elsewhere. As if they were so civilized when they didn't even speak Old Realm.

Wait, there it was again. Why did I have a smug, opinionated voice in the back of my head? I waited to hear it again, but nothing came.
